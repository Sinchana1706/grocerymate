    <h1>About Our Page</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Thank You!!!</h2>
    <h3>Hope you enjoyed shopping in Gro-cery mart</h3>
    <p><br>
        Whether fulfilling your weekly shopping list or preparing for Thanksgiving dinner, you’ll experience the same crowd every time… none! Grocery shopping online for home delivery allows you the pleasure of shopping from your dining room table, your couch, or your office, without navigating crowded aisles and lengthy cashier lines. That means having more time to do the things you love.
        Forget to add an item to your virtual shopping cart? No big deal. With online shopping, you can add items to your cart, even after having made the purchase, up until the day of delivery to your home. That means no more treks back to the store for that single item you forgot.
        A local grocery store has only limited storage space and cannot keep in stock every product that a consumer may want. These limitations do not apply to our store Gro-cery mate , which can offer you a much wider range of products than is likely to be available in-store. Thus an Gro-cery mate can fulfill even the most unusual requests.
